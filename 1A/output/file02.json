From time to time, ISTQB will update this document to reflect any additional extensions that shall be introduced for the Foundation Level, or to reflect major changes in existing ones. Publications of the updated document will be available on the ISTQB website. The ISTQB Foundation and Advanced Level syllabi have been defined and have been on the market for some time. New topics emerge due to technology and methodology changes in the market which often are brought into the ISTQB program as new Expert Level syllabi. However, not all topics are suited for the Expert Level. For this reason, the extension syllabi are established at the Foundation Level to expand the ISTQB program to incorporate new or updated knowledge. New extensions shall be discussed and introduced by the ISTQB periodically. Extensions may be established at the Advanced Level as well, but that is beyond the scope of this document. The following Foundation Level Extension syllabus has been released: Agile Tester In this document, each Foundation Level Extension syllabus is summarized and the associated Business Outcomes are stated. The Business Outcomes communicate what can be expected from a person who achieves a Foundation Level Extension Certification in a particular subject area (e.g., Agile Tester), and will outline the benefits for companies that are considering the development of specific testing skills at this level.",
