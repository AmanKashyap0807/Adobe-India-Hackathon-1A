1) Make sure the following are installed:
Python (3.7+ recommended)
pip (Python package manager)
VS Code
VS Code extensions:
Python extension (by Microsoft)
Jupyter (for running .ipynb, optional)

2) Either a .py file (recommended for production)
Or a .ipynb Jupyter Notebook (to mirror Colab)

3)pip install reportlab pillow pdfplumber pymupdf pandas numpy

4)
pdf_project/
├── pdf_extractor.py
├── sample_pdfs/         ← this will be auto-created

5)!pip works only in Colab; use pip install in terminal instead

6)  Run the script with python pdf_extractor.py

Else files also executed in similar manner 

These three codes are for different uses :--
1) extraction codes
the untitled5 is a basic code for extraction 
having several attributes like page no ,text ,font ,name,size ,coordinates ,top ,bottom,etc 

2) the adobe_testing_pdfs is also a extraction code with little enhanced version of the untitled5 codefile

now the last code file which is claude_adv is a full fledged code generated with some tweaks and the
pdf u provided with the help of those ir is full fledge code but might need some checks and all as it is 
first copy all three codes are error free and creates csv files for model training the last two code also creates json files
along with a png to show the execution and the output of the code also all 3 codes generates the test 
pdf of their own but the codes are not hardcoded for those pdfs also the pdf which they generate are diverse
from tables to simple font to multiple font and all
